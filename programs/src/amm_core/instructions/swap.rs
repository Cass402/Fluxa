/// Swap Instruction Module
///
/// This module implements the core swap functionality for the Fluxa AMM.
/// Swaps allow users to exchange one token for another using the liquidity available
/// in a pool, with the exchange rate determined by the current price and the
/// constant product formula within each active tick range.
///
/// The swap execution updates the pool's price and transfers tokens between
/// the user's accounts and the pool's vaults, collecting fees in the process.
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;

/// Handler function for executing a token swap
///
/// This function executes a swap between token A and token B, calculating the
/// output amount based on the current pool price and liquidity. It verifies that
/// the resulting output meets the minimum amount required by the user to protect
/// against slippage, and updates the pool state accordingly.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `ctx` - The context containing all accounts involved in the operation
/// * `amount_in` - The amount of input tokens to swap
/// * `min_amount_out` - The minimum acceptable amount of output tokens
/// * `is_token_a` - Whether the input token is token A (true) or token B (false)
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<()>` - Result indicating success or failure
///
/// # Errors
/// * `ErrorCode::SlippageExceeded` - If the output amount is less than min_amount_out
/// * `ErrorCode::InsufficientLiquidity` - If there's not enough liquidity to execute the swap
