use crate::CollectFees;
/// Collect Fees Instruction Module
///
/// This module implements the instruction for collecting accumulated trading fees
/// from a liquidity position in the Fluxa AMM. As trades occur through a pool,
/// fees accrue to the liquidity providers proportional to their contribution
/// within the active price range.
///
/// The fee collection process calculates the fees earned since the last collection,
/// updates the position's accounting, and transfers the fee tokens to the owner.

///
/// This function calculates the fees earned by a position since the last collection,
/// transfers those fees from the pool's vaults to the owner's accounts, and updates
/// the position's accounting to reflect the collection.
///
/// Fees are earned when trades occur through price ranges where the position has
/// provided liquidity, with the amount earned proportional to the position's share
/// of the total liquidity in that range.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `ctx` - The context containing all accounts involved in the operation

/// # Returns
/// * `Result<()>` - Result indicating success or failure
